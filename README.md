# system-info

[![hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/system-info.svg?logo=haskell&label=system-info)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/system-info)

A small library for getting the name of the OS.

__NOTE__: the library used to give information about CPUs, as well. However, it wasn't reliable enough.
If you need such functionality, I'd recommend trying [hlibcpuid](https://github.com/dtaskoff/hlibcpuid).
